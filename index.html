      <h2>History of Animation</h2>
      <p>
        Animation is an art form that has evolved over centuries. It started with early experiments like the Zoetrope in the 19th century, which created the illusion of motion by spinning images in a circular frame. The 20th century saw the rise of pioneers like Walt Disney, who revolutionized the industry with the introduction of synchronized sound and color animation, as seen in the iconic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, animation is an integral part of filmmaking, video games, and web development. The rise of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has made animation more immersive and interactive, with advanced software such as Blender, Toon Boom Harmony, and After Effects becoming industry standards.
