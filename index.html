    <h2>History of Animation</h2>
    <p>
      Animation has been a part of storytelling for centuries, starting with early cave drawings that depicted movement in sequence. In the 19th century, devices like the zoetrope were invented, giving the illusion of motion through spinning images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, pioneers like Walt Disney revolutionized animation by introducing full-length animated feature films, such as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in 1937. Today, animation has evolved into a highly advanced industry with the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI).
