      <h2>History of Animation</h2>
      <p>
        Animation has evolved from simple flip books and hand-drawn sequences to modern CGI-powered films. I have learned about the pioneers of animation like Walt Disney and his works, such as "Steamboat Willie" and "Snow White," laid the foundation for modern animation and inspired me to learn the craft. The 21st century has seen rapid growth in computer-generated imagery (CGI), making animation more realistic. 
        However, I still feel that animation is seen as this "other" cateogory of films that are only meant for children, though there are movies, such as Caroline (2009) and Spirited Away (2002) that were accepted both by critics and mainstream audiences, 
        but there is still a different category for animation in film festivals and award ceremonies that separate them from the idea of films. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, animation plays a critical role in film, video games, advertisements, public service announcements, and there is also an availability of software like Toon Boom Harmony, Procreate, and Blender becoming industry standards for animators worldwide, which gives individuals the opportunity to venture on solo-animation projects- for instance, check out: https://www.youtube.com/@OlofStorm.
