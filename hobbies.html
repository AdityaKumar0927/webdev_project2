    <h2>2D Animation</h2>
    <p>
      In my freshman year of high school, my parents bought me an iPad, so I began sketching characters on Procreate, and they had recently launched the new feature for animation. I started creating traditional frame-by-frame animated videos. Though it was easier to animate compared to doing it on paper, I got tired of animating every frame repeatedly.
      Later, I came across Toon Boom Harmony and bought the software, which is an industry-grade tool (Rick & Morty was made on it). I learned how to rig characters, even creating full 360-degree view characters, and animate them for various projects. For instance, during high school, I made a video explaining the value of pi and how to calculate the area of a circle by rigging an animated teacher and adding a voice-over. Toon Boom Harmony provided tools to sync my voice-over with the animated character's lip movements, which was quite fascinating.
